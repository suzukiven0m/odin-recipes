    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Large Potatoes</li>
            <li>6 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Medium Onion</li>
            <li>1 Cup Olive Oil (250ml)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep the Potatoes & Onion: Thinly slice the potatoes (about 2-3mm thick). If using onion, finely chop it.</li>
            <li>Fry the Potatoes & Onion: In a large non-stick pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.Add the potatoes and onion, ensuring they are well coated in oil. Cook gently for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are soft but not crispy. Drain the potatoes and onion, reserving a little bit of the oil for later.</li>
            <li>Whisk the Eggs: In a large bowl, beat the eggs with salt and pepper. Add the drained potatoes and onion, stirring to coat everything evenly. Let it sit for 5 minutes to absorb flavors.</li>
            <li>Cook the Tortilla: In the same pan, heat a couple of tablespoons of the reserved oil over medium heat. Pour in the egg-potato mixture and spread it evenly. Cook for 4-5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.</li>
            <li>The Legendary Flip: Place a large plate over the pan, hold it firmly, and flip the tortilla onto the plate. Slide it back into the pan to cook the other side for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve & Enjoy: Once golden and slightly firm, slide the tortilla onto a plate. Let it cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm, cold, or at midnight straight from the fridge. ðŸ˜‹</li>
