    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gambas al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp) is a Spanish tapas classic that delivers maximum flavor with minimal effort. Succulent shrimp sizzle in a bubbling pool of olive oil, infused with garlic, chili, and a hint of smoky paprika. It’s fast, flavorful, and best enjoyed with crusty bread to mop up every last drop of that golden, garlicky goodness.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300g Raw Shrimp</li>
            <li>6 Garlic Cloves</li>
            <li>80ml Olie Oil</li>
            <li>1 Dried Red Chilli</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Crusty Bread</li>
            <li>Fresh Parsley</li>   
            <li>Lemon Wedge</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep the Shrimp: Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel. Season lightly with salt.</li>
            <li>Infuse the Oil: In a large pan or cazuela (earthenware dish), heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic slices and chili, cooking until the garlic turns golden (about 2 minutes). Be careful—don’t let it burn!</li>
            <li>Cook the Shrimp: Increase the heat to medium-high and add the shrimp. Sprinkle in the paprika and cook for 2-3 minutes, flipping the shrimp until they turn pink and opaque.</li>
            <li>Serve Immediately:Remove from heat and sprinkle with fresh parsley.Squeeze a bit of lemon juice (if using) and serve piping hot with crusty bread.</li>
            <li>Warning: The oil is dangerously delicious—you might forget the shrimp and just dunk bread in it! 😆 🍞🔥</li>
